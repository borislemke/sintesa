It was a HUGE room with a king size bed on one side and a big sitting area on the other. <br><br>HUGE bathroom too. Also has an open terrace overlooking the pool. Could easily accommodate a family of four! Thumbs up for the food &amp; drinks served at the hotel's Trattoria. We also enjoyed our massage session at the Esthetic Spa. The staffs were very friendly &amp; helpful - booked taxis, recommended places of interest, etc. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay @ Pinkcoco. If I must find some fault, I would request for better quality bath towels and for the rooster to crow at more appropriate times!",

We enjoyed the open feeling of the place and the walk to the beach was shorter then we expected. There are shops all around which is good. We have extended our stay here after looking at other places around bali why pay twice or three times as much to stay in a big resort where you feel boxed in! Here it is easy, peaceful and relaxing.",
